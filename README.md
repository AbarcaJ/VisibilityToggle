## VisibilityToggle
Hello!, This is the VisibilityToggle repository, because I have stopped creating plugins for Minecraft I have decided to leave the code free so that all the users who have accompanied the project until now, over these years, can continue using it and modify it according to the needs of your server.

### Get Started
To start modifying you just need to clone the repository and add Spigot-1.16.5 in your build path as a dependency.

Without further ado, thank you for using VisibilityToggle, if it has been useful to you, I would appreciate it if you could leave your star as a show of support!
